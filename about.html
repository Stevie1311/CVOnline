                    <p>I’m 58, I left school in 1980, and over the next two years, I was on two ‘Youth Opportunities Program’ placements, one was making lampshade frames, the other was working in a textile warehouse, that’s the only recollection I have of them. .<br><br></p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <p>In mid-1982, I applied to be a trainee croupier, I was lucky enough to be accepted.  After training I went on to enjoy eight years working in casino’s in the centre of Manchester, Stockport and finally 6 months in Prague. .<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>After returning from Prague, after a short career break , I wanted to change careers.  I took two training courses, resulting in a NVQ level 2 in business administration. .<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>My first administration job was at Airtours, starting in 1994, staying with them for 6 years.  I left when they moved location from Helmshore to Bury, I don’t drive, so it would have meant an additional couple of hours on travel to and from work every day.<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>After leaving Airtours, i had a two year gap in employment due to personal reasons.<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>From 2002 to 2005, I had seven temporary jobs, it sounds a lot, but they were fixed term contracts where the employer need someone for a set length of time.<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>In late 2005, I first ventured into the world of IT.  The job was originally closing open calls in preparation for the TSB’s IT contract being transferred from IBM to Fujitsu.  The opportunity to TUPE over arose on the last day of the contract, and I grabbed it with both hands.  I spent two enjoyable years working for them in Bristol, before returning to Manchester.<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>On returning to Manchester, I took a job as a receptionist for the Probation Service before the opportunity to get back into IT came along.<br><br></p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>I joined the Co-Operative Group in mid-2008, as a IT Service Desk Analyst.  After a brief spell working during the day, I was offered the opportunity to work overnight.  From then until the end of my time with them, I worked night shifts, supporting all areas of the business.  In 2018 the Co-Operative outsourced their IT support to TATA, I spent the next 2 years working from them until I was made redundant at the end of 2020.<br><br></p>
